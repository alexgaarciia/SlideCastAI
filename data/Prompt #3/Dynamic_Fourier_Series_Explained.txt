Welcome to our exploration of the Fourier Series Representation of Periodic Signals. This fascinating concept is a cornerstone in understanding and analyzing signals in both continuous and discrete-time systems.

First, let's delve into harmonically-related complex exponentials. These form the basis of the Fourier series, representing signals as combinations of fundamental frequency components. Imagine a musical note composed of different harmonics, each contributing to the overall sound.

Now, we'll explore the Fourier series itself. This is where we break down complex periodic signals into simpler sinusoidal components. It's like analyzing a complex musical composition by identifying its individual notes.

Determining the Fourier series coefficients is next. These coefficients quantify the contribution of each sinusoidal component to the overall signal. It's akin to identifying the volume and pitch of each note in our musical analogy.

We'll also cover the properties of the Fourier series in continuous-time signals. This includes understanding how different signal properties affect the Fourier series representation.

Examples are crucial for solidifying our understanding. We'll look at practical examples of Fourier series representations, illustrating how this theory is applied in real-world scenarios.

Now, let's turn to discrete-time signals. Here, we'll discuss how the Fourier series applies to signals sampled at discrete intervals. This is important in the digital world, where most signals are processed in discrete time.

The synthesis and analysis equations of the Fourier series in discrete-time will be our focus. These equations are vital for reconstructing signals and understanding their frequency components.

Properties of the Fourier series in discrete-time signals come next. We'll delve into how these properties differ from continuous-time signals and their implications.

And of course, examples will follow, providing practical insights into the application of Fourier series in discrete-time scenarios.

Finally, we'll discuss Fourier series and Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. Understanding how Fourier series interacts with LTI systems is crucial in fields like telecommunications and audio processing.

We'll wrap up by looking at how Fourier series are used to analyze the output of LTI systems, a key concept in signal processing.

Throughout this exploration, I'll provide real-world examples and applications to bring these concepts to life. So, let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of Fourier series.
