Welcome to our exploration of Fourier Series Representation of Periodic Signals, an essential concept in signal processing and systems analysis. Let's delve into this fascinating topic and discover its practical applications.

Our journey begins with the representation of continuous-time signals. We start with harmonically-related complex exponentials, which are fundamental to understanding the Fourier series. These components are like the individual notes in a musical chord, each contributing to the overall sound.

Next, we'll explore the Fourier series itself. This mathematical tool breaks down complex periodic signals into simpler sinusoidal components. It's akin to decomposing a complex musical composition into its individual notes and rhythms.

The determination of the Fourier series coefficients is crucial. These coefficients represent the amplitude and phase of each component in the signal. Understanding them is key to reconstructing the original signal accurately.

We'll also discuss the properties of the Fourier series in continuous-time signals. These properties help us understand how different types of signals behave and how they can be manipulated for various applications, like in telecommunications and audio processing.

Now, let's turn to discrete-time signals. The principles of Fourier series apply here too, allowing us to analyze signals sampled at discrete intervals, which is vital in digital signal processing.

We will look at practical examples of Fourier series representations, illustrating how this theory is applied in real-world scenarios. From audio signal processing to telecommunications, the Fourier series plays a pivotal role in modern technology.

Finally, we'll explore the application of Fourier series in Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. In these systems, Fourier series help us understand how different frequency components of a signal are processed, crucial in fields like electrical engineering and control systems.

Throughout our exploration, we'll connect these concepts to their real-world applications, demonstrating the practical utility of Fourier series in various fields.
